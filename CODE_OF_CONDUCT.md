# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to a respectful, harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of positive behavior:

- Being respectful and constructive.
- Accepting feedback gracefully.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Harassment, insults, or discrimination.
- Trolling or personal attacks.
- Publishing private information without permission.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards and may remove or reject contributions that violate them.

## Reporting and Escalation

- For Code of Conduct concerns, contact the maintainer privately on GitHub: `@svenschaefer`.
- Include links/screenshots/context to help triage quickly.
- Reports will be reviewed promptly and handled confidentially where possible.

If behavior involves a potential security issue, report via `SECURITY.md` instead of public channels.
