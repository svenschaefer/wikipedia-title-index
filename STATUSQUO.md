# Implementation Status (Current)

- Package is functional and published-oriented as `wikipedia-title-index` (`v1.2.6`).
- Core capabilities are implemented:
  - Streaming index build from file/URL
  - Local SQLite title index
  - Local HTTP service with constrained SQL endpoint
  - CLI commands: `build`, `serve`, `query`, `cache clear`, `status`, `clean`
- Query model is clearly split:
  - CLI `query`: title/prefix lookup only
  - REST `POST /v1/titles/query`: policy-constrained SQL `SELECT`
- Operational features in place:
  - Auto-setup on first run (unless disabled)
  - Build/service lock files with stale-lock recovery
  - Query cache with TTL/size controls and clear command
- Quality/verification:
  - Test suite currently passing (`19/19`)
  - OpenAPI lint passes
  - Release process doc updated and aligned with actual scripts
- Documentation/status:
  - Main docs are up to date (`README.md`, `docs/OPS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `NPM_RELEASE.md`)
  - Security triage captured in `TODO.md`
- Known deferred items (intentional, low priority for local-only use):
  - HTTP (no TLS) on local server
  - Potential internal error-message exposure in 5xx responses
- Recent repo hygiene:
  - Local helper scripts are ignored via `.gitignore` (`cody.bat`, `serve.bat`)
