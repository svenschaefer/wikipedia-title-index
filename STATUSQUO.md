# Implementation Status (Current)

- `wikipedia-title-index` is implemented and operational at `v1.2.6` with a stable Node `>=24.10.0` CommonJS package setup.
- Core functionality is complete:
  - Streaming index build from local file or URL
  - Local SQLite title index
  - Local HTTP service (`GET /health`, `POST /v1/titles/query`)
  - CLI commands: `build`, `serve`, `query`, `cache clear`, `status`, `clean`
- Query model is clearly separated:
  - CLI `query` = title/prefix lookup only
  - REST query endpoint = policy-constrained SQL `SELECT`
- Runtime safeguards are in place:
  - Auto-setup behavior (with opt-out)
  - Build/service lock handling with stale-lock recovery
  - Query cache with TTL/size controls and cache-clear command
- Engineering baseline is mature:
  - Cross-platform CI + manual release workflow
  - Dependabot, CODEOWNERS, PR/issue templates
  - Optional ESLint baseline (`npm run lint`) integrated
  - Smoke-pack validation script (`npm run smoke:pack`)
  - Non-blocking production `npm audit` CI job
- Test/validation status is green:
  - `22/22` tests passing
  - OpenAPI lint passing
  - Pack dry-run passing via `ci:check`
- Documentation is comprehensive and aligned:
  - Ops, package contract, guarantees, migration, maintenance, release process/templates, workflows, baseline test guidance, status docs
  - Markdown audit performed; release smoke version-check instruction aligned with package `exports`
- Known deferred security hardening (tracked, local-only risk accepted):
  - localhost HTTP without TLS termination
  - possible 5xx internal message exposure path for unknown errors
